## Description

this is a a command-line application that accepts user input

when I start the application I am prompted for text I can enter up to three characters for my logo

I am then prompted for the text color which allows me to enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

then I am prompted for a shape which presents me with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square

after I am prompted for the shape's color, I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

when I have entered input for all the prompts a SVG file is created named `logo.svg`

after the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line

when I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
